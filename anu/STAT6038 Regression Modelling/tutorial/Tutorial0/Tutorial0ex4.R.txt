# Use logical expressions to subset out the two locations:
age1 <- age[location==1]
weight1 <- weight[location==1]
age2 <- age[location==2]

# is a sensible approach in this instance, as the data is sorted by age
# within each location:

location1.lm <- lm(weight1 ~ age1)

# This may not work, as the breaks may no longer span the range of values in

# If you not are using the same workspace as you did for exercise 2,

# current working directory and execute the following code, which is 
# currently shown commented out:

# ws2.women <- read.csv("worksheet2_women.csv", header=F)
# names(ws2.women) <- c("Height", "Weight")

# If you are using the same workspace, then all you need to do is:

attach(ws2.women)

lm(Weight ~ Height)$coef

# Excluding observation 4 would make a big change in both coefficients.

# In percentage terms the coefficients would change by:

100 * beta.change(Weight, Height, 4)/lm(Weight ~ Height)$coef


# Part (f)

# Using the above beta.change() function:

jackknife.slope <- function(y, x) {
  n <- length(y)
  change <- rep(0, n)
  for(i in 1:n) {change[i] <- beta.change(y,x,i)[2]}
  (n-1)*mean(change)
}

# for the ws2.women dataset, we get:

jackknife.slope(Weight, Height)

# To generalise this function, we would have to allow the user to pass in
# their estimator, "theta()", as an argument to the function.

# beta.change() returns a vector showing the change in the regression coefficients
# rather than just the slope. To keep things simple, let's use a slightly simpler
# function and assume that we are always dealing with the sort of data described
# in the question, i.e. a data.frame with two columns, the first being x and the
# second y:

slope <- function(data){
  x <- data[,1]
  y <- data[,2]
  lm(y ~ x)$coef[2]
}
  
# So, a general jackknife function would look like:

jackknife <- function(data, theta){
  n <- nrow(data)
  change <- rep(0, n)
  for(i in 1:n) {change[i] <- theta(data) - theta(data[-i,])}
  (n-1)*mean(change)
}

# So, now with the ws2.women dataset and using the slope() function:

jackknife(ws2.women, slope)

# I will leave it as an exercise for you to think how you might modify this
# even further to allow for more general data input and more complex functions,
# but here are a couple more examples of using our existing jackknife function:

mean.x <- function(data) {
  x <- data[,1]
  mean (x)
}

mean.x(ws2.women)
mean(Height)

mean.y <- function(data) {
  y <- data[,2]
  mean (y)
} 

mean.y(ws2.women)
mean(Weight)

jackknife(ws2.women, mean.x)
jackknife(ws2.women, mean.y)

# Both very close to 0, which should not be big surprise as the sample mean 
# is an unbiased estimator (see the STAT2001 course for more details).
