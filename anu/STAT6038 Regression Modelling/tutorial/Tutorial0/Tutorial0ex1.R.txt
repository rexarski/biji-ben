# Part (b)

help(log)

# The default for the log() function is to compute logarithms to the base e, 
# i.e. natural logarithms, which are using referred to as ln in mathematics.
# If you want common logarithms (logs to the base 10), you can use log10(number) or
# log(number, base=10) and if you want binary logarithms use log(number, base=2).

?? operators

# The operator for doing ordinary numerical divsion is /, e.g.

4/2

# Also try the help files for the other new commands:
